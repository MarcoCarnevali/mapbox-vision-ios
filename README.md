# Overview

The current repository is a part of [Vision SDK](https://vision.mapbox.com).

The Vision SDK provides developers with cutting-edge AI and AR tools to build better driving experiences. Itâ€™s smart enough to understand the road, yet lean enough to run on devices that billions of drivers use everyday.

The key features are:
- Navigation in augemented reality;
- Scene segmentation;
- Sign detection;
- Safety alerts;
- Object detection;
- Lane detection.

Vision SDK for iOS contains several modules which built on top of Vision Core library (the implementation of Vision Core is in private repository):
  1. `Vision SDK` - an end-user SDK with a lot of helpers such as:
      * Device camera session implementation;
      * Interfaces and additional functions for an API data structures;
      * Views of segmentation, detection, for debugging purposes.
  1. `VisionAR SDK` for AR experience on iOS platform. It has own API to control:
      * configuration of AR lane:
          - lane's color;
          - lane's geometry;
          - lane's material (shaders, textures, parameters of light source.
      * customize occlusion;
      * draw custom objects?
      * add objects to draw as pins;
      * etc.
  1. `VisionSafety SDK` implements API for a safety features such as:
      * speed limits;
      * collision alerts;
      * etc.
