# Contributing

Everyone is invited to participate in Mapbox's open source projects and public discussions: we want to create a welcoming and friendly environment.

## Before you start

### Dev envrionment setup

<details>
<summary>Secret-shield setup</summary>
<p>

We use [secret-shield](https://github.com/mapbox/secret-shield) tool which runs as a pre-commit hook. In order to enable it you should install it with:
```sh
npm install -g @mapbox/secret-shield
```

Then you have to add a pre-commit git hook. The simplest option is to copy the following script into a `mapbox-vision-ios/.git/hooks/pre-commit`:
```sh
#!/bin/sh
secret-shield --pre-commit -C verydeep --enable "Mapbox Public Key" --disable "High-entropy base64 string" "Short high-entropy string" "Long high-entropy string"
```

Don't forget to make it executable:
```sh
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

As an option you can integrate hook via git hooks manager (like [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) or [Komondor](https://github.com/shibapm/Komondor)).
More information about installation is available [here](https://github.com/mapbox/secret-shield#install).
